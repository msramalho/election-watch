The good ones are irreplaceable, yet the bad are terrifying. Social Networks represent an ocean of information, where lie dissolves in truth, where anyone can dump a bucket of what they think is truth, or whatever they feel. This project is a small effort to <i>separate the waters</i>, of showing and acknowledging there the truth is in danger, just like justice, the planet, democracies and, <i>in extremis</i>, all of our lives and ways of living. The goal of this project is to give a more analytical and transparent look upon the reality of social networks in Portugal. In particular, to the Portuguese Presidential Elections of January 2021. <br> Election Watch is a child project of <a href='https://github.com/msramalho/twitter-watch/'>Twitter Watch</a>, a tool for data collection developed in the context of my <a href='https://msramalho.github.io/msc-thesis.pdf'>MSc thesis</a> at the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto. The source code is <a href='https://github.com/msramalho/election-watch'>open-source</a> and any citizen can <a href='https://github.com/msramalho/election-watch/issues'>make suggestions or report bugs</a>.",
